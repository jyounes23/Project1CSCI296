# Project1CSCI296

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether there will be an early Spring or if Winter will continue for six more weeks, improving upon the historical predictions made by Punxsutawney Phil every year on February 2nd (Groundhog Day). The goal is to achieve greater accuracy than Philâ€™s current prediction accuracy, providing more reliable seasonal forecasts for businesses and individuals who rely on these changes.
